'''Joe Veillette''' (born March 13, 1946) is an American [[luthier]] and the founder of Veillette Guitars, based in Woodstock, New York. He is known for pioneering baritone guitars and high-tuned 12-string instruments such as the Gryphon. Over a career spanning five decades, Veillette has been recognized for applying his architectural training and experience as a performing musician to guitar design, producing instruments adopted by a wide range of prominent artists.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010">{{cite journal |last=Eck |first=Michael |title=Alchemy; Joe Veillette unleashed the magical energy of wood |journal=The Fretboard Journal |volume=20 |date=Winter 2010 |page=78}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Veillette was born in Brooklyn, New York. Growing up, he listened extensively to doo-wop groups such as The Penguins and Dion and the Belmonts, as well as singers like Jackie Wilson.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" /> He studied architecture at the [[City College of New York]], where he earned a Bachelor of Architecture. After graduation he worked as a designer on Park Avenue, a role he described as prestigious but ultimately unfulfilling.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

== Transition to luthiery ==
The catalyst for Veillette’s shift from architecture to instrument building came in 1971 when the headstock on his Gibson J-45 acoustic broke. After several failed repairs, he took a guitar-making class from [[Michael Gurian (luthier)|Michael Gurian]] in Greenwich Village with the initial goal of fixing his own guitar. The experience sparked an interest that led him to leave architecture to pursue luthiery full-time.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

His approach to instrument design reflected his architectural background: emphasizing structure, ergonomics, and function. Veillette described his philosophy as creating “tools for musicians,” designed to solve problems and expand expressive possibilities rather than serve as decorative objects.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

== Veillette-Citron (1976–1983) ==
In 1976, Veillette partnered with fellow architect and guitarist Harvey Citron to form Veillette-Citron Guitars. The firm debuted at the Summer NAMM show that year and quickly drew attention for handcrafted guitars and basses using exotic tonewoods such as koa and walnut.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rorick |first=Baker |title=Sculptured Beauties: The Age of Veillette-Citron Guitars |journal=Guitar Shop |date=November 1997 |page=84}}</ref>

The company was notable for:
* Early use of neck-through-body construction, enhancing sustain and stability.  
* Proprietary humbucking pickups with coil-tap and phase options.  
* Hand-tooled brass hardware and fully adjustable bridges.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />  

One of Veillette-Citron’s most significant innovations was the creation of the first production electric baritone guitar, the “Shark,” designed in 1978 at the request of [[John Sebastian]].<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" /> The Shark and other Veillette-Citron models were used by artists including [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[James Taylor]], Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads, Michael Anthony of Van Halen, and members of Blondie and the B-52’s.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

Despite critical success, the partnership ended in 1983. Roughly 500 instruments were built during its seven-year run, which remain highly sought after by collectors.

== Performance career ==
After Veillette-Citron dissolved, Veillette focused on performing. He led the band The Phantoms, which became a popular act in New York’s Hudson Valley. The group performed both in full-band and a cappella formats at venues such as the Bottom Line, the Lone Star Café, and Radio City Music Hall, and appeared regularly on Soupy Sales’ NBC radio show.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

During this period he also worked as a session musician. His credits include guitar and vocals on Krishna Das’s ''All One'' (2005), produced by Walter Becker of Steely Dan, as well as recordings with John Sebastian and Jorma Kaukonen.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

== Woodstock Music Products and Avante (1991–1995) ==
Veillette returned to instrument building in 1991 through a partnership with bass builder Stuart Spector at Woodstock Music Products. There he introduced the “Deep-6” baritone conversion neck for Fender-style guitars.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Bob |title=Veillette Gryphon High 12, Acoustic 12-string |journal=Performing Musician |date=April 2009}}</ref>

He also collaborated with Michael Tobias to design the Avante line of acoustic, baritone, and bass guitars for Alvarez. This was his first experience with overseas production, balancing boutique design principles with large-scale manufacturing.

== Veillette Guitars (1995–present) ==
In 1995, Veillette founded Veillette Guitars in Woodstock, New York. The shop remains small, typically three to four people producing five or six instruments per month, including production manager Ande Chase and guitarist-luthier Jimmy Eppard.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Veillette Guitars |url=https://www.veilletteguitars.com/about.shtml |publisher=Veillette Guitars |access-date=2025-08-31}}</ref>

=== Notable models ===
* '''Gryphon''' – A short-scale (18.5") 12-string tuned D–D in unison pairs, producing a high-pitched, mandolin-like sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kotapish |first=Paul |title=Veillette Acoustic Gryphon High 12 Review |journal=Acoustic Guitar |date=November 2007}}</ref> The model was later licensed for Korean production under the Avante name.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gore |first=Joe |title=Veillette Avante Gryphon Review |magazine=Premier Guitar |date=March 2015}}</ref>
* '''Aero''' – A chambered electric-acoustic hybrid with a spruce top and pin bridge, designed for feedback-resistant amplified performance.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Veillette Releases the Aero Guitar |magazine=Premier Guitar |date=2014}}</ref>
* '''Paris Bass''' – A chambered bass combining magnetic and piezo pickups for both electric punch and acoustic resonance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Veillette Paris Bass |url=https://veilletteguitars.com/electric_bass_paris.shtml |publisher=Veillette Guitars |access-date=2025-08-31}}</ref>
* '''Flyer''' – A compact acoustic guitar with shallow body, radiused top, and oval soundhole, praised for its mid-range forward “bluesy bark.”<ref>{{cite web |title=Flyer Acoustic |url=https://veilletteguitars.com/flyer_acoustic.shtml |publisher=Veillette Guitars |access-date=2025-08-31}}</ref>

Veillette’s designs often include a zero fret for consistent intonation and a single-bolt neck joint that allows easy adjustment.

== Design philosophy ==
Veillette is noted for systematically manipulating scale length as a design variable, creating families of instruments from high-tuned 12-strings to extended-range baritones. He has described the approach as analogous to the difference between a violin and a viola: structurally similar, but voiced to distinct ranges.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" />

== Reception and notable users ==
Veillette’s instruments have been documented in use by a range of artists:

* [[John Sebastian]] collaborated on the Shark baritone in 1978 and has continued to perform on Veillette baritones.<ref name="FretboardJournal2010" /><ref>{{cite web |title=John Sebastian and Veillette Baritone Acoustic |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQbyEFHUFv8 |publisher=YouTube |date=2018}}</ref>
