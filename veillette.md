'''Joe Veillette''' (born March 13, 1946), is a [[luthier]] and the owner of Veillette Guitars. He specializes in the crafting of unusual and innovative handmade guitars, basses, and other stringed instruments.

== Early life ==
Veillette is originally from [[Brooklyn]], New York. He earned a Bachelor of Architecture degree at [[City College of New York]], and was subsequently employed as an architectural designer on Park Avenue. 

== "Woodstock Music Products" and "Veillette Guitars" ==
He took a class in guitar-making, taught by luthier [[Michael_Gurian_(luthier)|Michael Gurian]] in 1971, to learn how to repair the broken headstock on his Gibson J-45. He became interested in guitar building and teamed up with fellow architectural student Harvey Citron, and formed Veillette-Citron in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eck |first=Michael |title=Alchemy; Joe Veillette unleashed the magical energy of wood |journal=The Fretboard Journal |volume=20 |date=Winter 2010 |page=78}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kotapish |first=Paul |title=Veillette Acoustic Gryphon High 12 Review, A striking, high-tuned 12-string that stakes out new tone territory |publisher=Acoustic Guitar |date=November 2007}}</ref> Veillette-Citron collaborated with [[John Sebastian]] to develop and market the first production baritone guitar. Veillette-Citron pioneered neck-thru-body construction, made innovations in instrument electronics, and set new trends in modern electric bass design. Early Veillete-Citron instruments are rare and highly sought-after as a result of their excellence in craftsmanship and innovative designs. The company moved from Brooklyn to Kingston NY in 1976. The partnership lasted until 1983.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rorick |first=Baker |title=Sculptured Beauties, The Age Of Veillette-Citron Guitars |publisher=Guitar Shop |date=November 1997 |page=84}}</ref>

Veillette formed Woodstock Music Products in 1991, in partnership with bass-maker Stuart Spector. One of Veillette's innovations developed during the partnership was the Deep-6 neck, which allowed a baritone conversion for Fender-style instruments.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Bob |title=Veillette Gryphon High 12, Acoustic 12-string  |publisher=Performing Musician Magazine |date=April 2009}}</ref> Veillette, in conjunction with bass-maker Michael Tobias, developed the Avante line of instruments for Alvarez. The Veillette/Spector partnership ended in 1994.

Veillette then established Veillette Guitars, in Woodstock NY.  He has focused on making unusual instruments, rather than trying to compete in a saturated market of OEM clone-makers. One of his most notable guitars is the Gryphon - a short (18.5.1‚Äù) scale 12 string guitar tuned D-D in unison courses, almost a full octave above standard tuning. This instrument can be played to sound like a [[mandolin]], [[bouzouki]], [[Cuatro_(instrument)|cuatro]], and other traditional folk instruments. Veillette licensed production of his acoustic Gryphon model as a high quality import from Korea, and revived the Avante name to market this instrument as well as versions of the acoustic baritone 6 and 12 string he is also known for.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gore |first=Joe |title=Veillette Avante Gryphon Review |magazine=Premier Guitar |date=March 2015 |page=78}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Pete |title=Avante Gryphon, Game Changer? |publisher=Vintage Guitar Magazine |date=March 2015}}</ref>
